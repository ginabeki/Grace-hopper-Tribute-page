                Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and the FLOW-MATIC programming language she created using this theory was later extended to create COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. Prior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. 
                 Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. 
                 She instead joined the Navy Reserves. 
                 Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken.
                  In 1949, she joined the Eckert Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. 
                  At Eckert Mauchly she managed the development of one of the first COBOL compilers. 
                  She believed that a programming language based on English was possible. 
                  Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. 
                  By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System.

                  During her wartime service, she co-authored three papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1. 
                  Following her retirement from the Navy, she was hired as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). 
                  Hopper was initially offered a position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on going through the typical formal interview process. 
                  She then proposed in jest that she would be willing to accept a position which made her available on alternating Thursdays, exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer, in exchange for a generous salary and unlimited expense account. 
                  Instead, she was hired as a full-time Principal Corporate Consulting Engineer, a tech-track SVP-equivalent. 
                  In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations. 
                  She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992. At DEC Hopper served primarily as a goodwill ambassador. 
                  She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users. 
                  She visited most of Digital's engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks. 
                  Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures contrary to U.S. Department of Defense policy.
